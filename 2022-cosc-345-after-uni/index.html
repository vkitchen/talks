					# Post Uni
					## (What is being a developer like as a recent graduate)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Less programming than you think
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Lots more everything else
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Lots more everything else
					1. Team work, syncing up, understanding others code
					2. Requirements gathering, feature testing
					3. Not productive for 8 hours
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Uni doesn't set you up for this
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Uni doesn't set you up for this
					* Assignments are usually well scoped
					* Team mates have a similar background
					* Projects are always greenfield
					* They're small enough to not divide
					* And have little communication overhead
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Uni sets you up for the later years not the first years
					* Broad base of awareness
					* Confidence to learn not be taught
					* = pick up skills to drive success
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## You'll see this once you work with other developers
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## So how to set up for the first years?
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					* What does the job include? Programming, testing, feature design, debugging, documentation, working with team, making compromises, improving knowledge in the team
					* What language? Depends what you look for?
					* What tools? Use a lot. Many job dependent
					* What is difference between remote and local? Communication, scheduling, isolation
					* What is difference between different company?
					* What is culture like? How they see themselves on what they focus on improving
					* Which company to work for?
					* Frontend or Engineer or which thing to learn first? A bunch and try out and see what feels right, then dig in and specialise. Wide first, deep second
					* Technical or soft skills more important? Soft
					* Growing complexity to retain customers
					* Teaching and learning on the job
					* Assumption of expectations not true
					* Hired staff completely unlike requirements in advert
					* Imposter syndrome
					* Different knowledge levels. And parts of business
					* Interaction between teams
					* Software built in teams. Organisation efficiency
					* Nothing is ever documented enough
					* Not job title, but whatever is needed
					* Job specific skills
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					* Insidious self improvement and the cult of productivity
					* Professionalism, be on time, be ready to work
					* First few years, learning tools, team, programming. No theory
					* Second few years, hard projects, theory needed
					* Notion, Slack, NodeJS, AWS, Github, Github Actions, React
					* Migrations never finished. Code never clean
					* It takes a team to keep code running
					* Projects/features get cancelled, never for technical reasons, and happen at any point
					* Having a broad base is useful. And the point of Uni
					* Working in any specialisation it gets out of date quick
					* Learn to use a computer, an editor, and type
					* Most advice is bad. We don't know what we're doing but we know people who can do it
