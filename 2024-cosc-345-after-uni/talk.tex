\item 10 lines per developer per day averaged --- Mythical Man Month (1975)

\begin{frame}{Code is living}
\begin{itemize}

\item The intent of the code is what's most important
\item Bugs can be fixed after the fact, intent can't
\item Code is like the Blind Men and Elephant story
	\begin{itemize}
	\item A snake?
	\item A fan?
	\item A tree-trunk?
	\item A wall?
	\item A rope?
