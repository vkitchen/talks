\begin{frame}{Getting a job}
\begin{itemize}
\item People skills --- You will be in a team
\item Demonstration of interest --- Grades, projects, blog, LeetCode, ability to explain your degree. Show your learning
\item They are looking for people who want to learn

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Interviews I've had}
\begin{itemize}
\item Expect 2--4 stages

\begin{frame}{Salary negotiation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Always negotiate your salary

\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{What do you do in a job}
\begin{itemize}
\item Not that much programming
\item 10 lines per developer per day --- Mythical Man Month (1975)

\item Not an order of magnitude higher
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Lots of other things}
\begin{itemize}
\item You are paid for problem solving
\item Not just being a code monkey
\item You will do requirements gathering
\item Debating code, reviewing PRs
\item Feature testing
\item Alignment and team work
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Where does the time go}
\begin{itemize}
\item Less than 8 hours of productivity
\item Lots of code reading
\item Debugging to understand the code you're modifying
\item Debugging bugs
\item Testing
\item Documenting
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Code is living}
\begin{itemize}
\item Team members come and go
\item You can't keep the whole app in your head
\item The intent of the code needs to be understood
\item Code is like the Three Blind Men and An Elephant
\item It takes a lot to ship even one line of code
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Uni doesn't teach you on the job skills}
\begin{itemize}
\item Assignments are pre-scoped
